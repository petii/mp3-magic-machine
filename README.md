# M^3 $\rightarrow$ the MP3 Magic Machine
A learning project which also is hopefully solving a real problem (at least for me.)

**Background:**
band practice recordings (recorded by the drummer) are shared in WAV which takes up way too much space. I took the responsibility upon myself to convert these to MP3s which take up significantly less space.

**Problem statement:**
doing this weekly is inconvinient.

**Proposed solution:**
blob storage in the cloud with a serverless function triggering off of new files and doing the conversions.

**Plus points and learning opportunities:**
  - putting my time spent learning rust to the test
  - learn about and get more confortable with GHA and IaC
